<h2>Seidel's method</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>

Iterative methods for solving systems of linear algebraic equations, in particular, the Seidel method. I developed a program for solving systems of equations using the Seidel method using the C++ language. The method is quite effective, as we achieved the desired accuracy in the solution in 5 iterations.
